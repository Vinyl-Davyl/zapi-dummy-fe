## Note to devs

- All routing has been done and pages created in the [pages]('./src/pages') folder.

- Check the components folder for components you need before creating one.

- The store has been setup.

- Do not touch the [store]('./src/redux/store.js') unless absolutely needed.

- Maintain the same convention for naming, import and exporting custom files.

- Check here for the [routing]('https://cacoo.com/diagrams/aGR874WctxJv1kA2/D1D31') workflow

- Check here for a comprehensive [Redux]('https://youtu.be/bbkBuqC1rU4') tutorial.
