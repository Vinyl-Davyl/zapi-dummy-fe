## Note to devs

- All routing has been done and pages created in the [pages]('./src/pages') folder.

- Check the components folder for components you need before creating one.

- The store has been setup.

- Do not touch the [store]('./src/redux/store.js') unless absolutely needed.

- Maintain the same convention for naming, import and exporting custom files.
