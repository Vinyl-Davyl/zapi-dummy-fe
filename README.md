## Note to devs

- All routing has been done and pages created in the [pages](./src/pages) folder. Do not make any changes to the URL paths in the [App.js](./src/App.js).

- Check the components folder for components you need before creating one.

- The store has been setup.

- Do not touch the [store](./src/redux/store.js) unless absolutely needed.

- Maintain the same convention for naming, import and exporting custom files.
